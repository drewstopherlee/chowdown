yield: 4 servings

ingredients:
- 1 (16 oz.) box elbow macaroni
- 2 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 (8 oz.) brick extra sharp cheddar cheese
- 1 (12 oz.) can evaporated milk
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 pinch white pepper
- 2 pinches dried mustard powder
- 1 tsp annatto seeds
- ½ tbsp of butter
- (Optional) Panko breadcrumbs
- (Optional) ½ tsp of unassuming vinegar (white or unseasoned rice vinegar are two options)

directions:
- Bring a pot of salted water to boil over high heat. Add your pasta to the pot.
- Add 2 tbsp of oil to a separate medium sauce pot and set to low heat.
- (Optional) Add 1 tsp of annatto seeds and heat until the oil is colored crimson. Removes seeds after a few seconds.)
- Grate the 8 oz. brick of extra-sharp cheddar cheese and add to pot.
- Pour the 12 oz. can of evaporated milk into the pot.
- Add salt and all your spices.
- Once the mixture is hot and all the cheese is dissolving, use a hand blender to emulsify it all into a creamy sauce. If you don’t have a hand blender, you can poor it into a counter-top blender or perhaps use a whisk.
- (Optional) If you find that the sauce is missing some “zing”, add a 1/2 tsp of vinegar.
- Once the pasta is cooked through, strain with a colander and set under the faucet of your sink. Wash away the excess starch with hot water.
- Add a portion of your cooked pasta into the cheese sauce. Mix and add more pasta if needed. Mix in a tab of butter to smooth out the flavors. Season to taste.
- Pour the ooey-gooey goodness into a heated bowl. Dust with breadcrumbs if using. Bask in its glory. Eat with fork or spoon - whatever floats your boat. Enjoy.
