ingredients:
- 2½ cups all purpose flour
- 1 tbsp sugar
- ⅛ tsp salt
- ⅓ cup water, boiling
- ⅔ cup warm milk (about 100°F) [if you are in a humid climate, reduce the milk amount by 1-2 tbsp]
- 1 tsp instant yeast
- 3 large eggs
- 1½ tbsp oil

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375°F.
- In a mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Mix with a spatula. Add boiling water and slowly incorporate.
- Microwave some cold milk for about 30 seconds or until hot; add yeast and mix.
- Pour into the flour and water mixture; add eggs and mix (The dough should be very sticky. DO NOT add more flour.)
- Rest for 20 mins with a lid on, then add oil. Oil should make the dough not sticky.
- Knead the dough until the oil is incorporated and it is sticky again. Cover and rest for 1 hour.
- After one hour, punch the dough with floured hands until you have let most of the air out. It should be about the size the dough was before resting.
- Split dough into three pieces.
- Flour a surface and roll it out, folding both ways in. Then, smooth side down, roll it out with a pin.
- With your hands, roll it into a roll (see video above) and place into a prepared bread tin. Rest in bread tin for 1 hour.
- Prepare egg wash; using a brush, baste a thin layer onto the bread dough.
- Bake at 375°F for 30 minutes.
- Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes. Serve by splitting the loaves open with your hands or cutting with a knife.

- Milk Bread Egg Wash
