ingredients:
- 1¾ cups all purpose flour
- ½ cup sugar
- ½ cup (packed) brown sugar
- 1 tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ cup shortening
- ½ cup peanut butter
- 2 tbsp milk

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F.
- Sift together flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.
- Using an electric mixer, cream together butter, peanut butter, sugar, and brown sugar until fluffy.
- Add egg, milk and vanilla; beat until well blended.
- Gradually add flour mixture, mixing thoroughly, until stiff dough forms. If the dough is very soft, refrigerate for about 1 hour.
- Shape dough into 1" balls; roll in sugar. Place 2 inches apart on ungreased cookie sheets.
