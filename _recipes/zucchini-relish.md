category: condiment
cuisine: American
yield: 7 pints
preptime: T50m
cooktime: T1h10m
totaltime: T12h

ingredients:
- 12 cups zucchini, unpeeled and shredded
- 4 cups onion, chopped
- 5 tbsp canning salt
- 6 cups sugar
- 2½ cups white vinegar
- 1 red bell pepper, chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 1½ tsp celery seed
- ¾ tsp ground nutmeg
- ¾ tsp ground turmeric
- ½ tsp ground black pepper

directions:
- Place zucchini and onion in a large, non-metallic bowl; sprinkle salt on top. Use your hands to evenly mix salt with zucchini. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
- Drain zucchini in a colander and rinse well with cool water. Squeeze out excess water; set zucchini aside.
- Place sugar, vinegar, red and green bell pepper, and cornstarch into a large pot. Add celery seed, nutmeg, turmeric, and black pepper. Stir to combine, then add drained zucchini. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes.
- Meanwhile, sterilize seven 1-pint jars and lids. Pack relish into sterilized jars, making sure there are no spaces or air pockets. Fill jars all the way to the top. Screw on the lids.
- Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with boiling water. Carefully lower jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary, until the tops of jars are covered by 2 inches of water. Bring water to a full boil, then cover and process for 30 minutes.
- Remove jars from the pot and place on a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all).
