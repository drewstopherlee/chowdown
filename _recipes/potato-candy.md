ingredients:
- 1 small-to-medium russet potato
- ½ cup (1 stick) of butter
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 7-9 cups of powdered confectioner's sugar
- Smooth peanut butter

directions:
- Peel, dice, and boil potato until very tender. Do not season potato or water.
- Drain potato pieces and mash very finely.
- Allow potato to sit at room temperature until completely cool.
- Combine mashed potato, butter, vanilla extract, and one cup of sugar in a large bowl and stir until combined.
- Add remaining sugar, 1 cup at a time and stirring until combined after each addition. Once you've added 6 cups of powdered sugar, check the consistency. If the dough is not moldable in your hands and can't be rolled into a ball, continue to add sugar until it is firm.
- Place some dough on a clean surface that you've generously dusted with powdered sugar. Dust the surface of the dough with additional sugar, and use a rolling pin to roll dough out into a rectangle about ¼" thick. If your dough is too sticky or falling apart, you may need to add more sugar, re-shape it into a ball, and start over.
- Once dough has been rolled into a ¼" thick rectangle, spread evenly with peanut butter, leaving a small amount of space peanut butter-free around the perimeter of the dough.
- Starting with the longer side of your rectangle, gently but tightly roll into a log.
- Use a knife to slice into pieces about ¼-½" thick. Lay these out flat on a sheet tray.
- Repeat steps 5-8 with any remaining dough.
- Serve and enjoy. Store leftover candy in an airtight container for up to a week.
