cuisine: American, Pennsylvania Dutch
yield: 6 servings
preptime: T5m
cooktime: T15m
totaltime: T20m

ingredients:
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp milk
- 1 cup flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- Sauerkraut

directions:
- In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs.
- Add all other ingredients except for the sauerkraut; mix with a fork until all ingredients are combined. Dough should be stiff enough so a dumpling holds it shape fairly well when you drop it from a spoon. If the dumpling spreads too much, add a little more flour.
- Add the sauerkraut to a large skillet and heat it until bubbling.
- Turn it down to a simmer and then drop the dumpling dough from a large spoon by pushing it off with your finger. Make the dumplings any size you desire. Just know that the dumplings will almost double in size when they are cooked.
- Once all the dumplings are on the sauerkraut, cover the pan and cook at a simmer for 12 minutes.
- Serve the sauerkraut and dumplings together.

If your rise is not pleasing, put in more baking powder. Some recipes call for up to a tbsp of baking powder.
Once it is the right consistency to drop and you do, close the pan and do NOT, I repeat, Do NOT look at the dumplings until done.
