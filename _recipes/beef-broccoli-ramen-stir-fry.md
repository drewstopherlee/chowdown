totaltime: T30m

ingredients:
- 2 (3 ounce) packages of ramen noodles, seasoning packets discarded
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 pound sirloin steak , trimmed of fat and sliced into 1½" strips (about ¼" thickness)
- ½ tsp kosher salt
- ½ tsp ground black pepper
- 3 cups fresh broccoli florets
- ½ cup of water
- Sesame seeds, for garnish

directions:
- Prepare sauce.
- Bring a medium pot of water to boil; cook ramen until just tender, 2-3 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop them from cooking longer. Drizzle with the 1 tsp sesame oil to prevent sticking.
- In a large non-stick skillet, warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once the skillet is glistening hot, season steak with the salt and pepper and add to the skillet. Cook for about 3 minutes, without moving, to allow them to brown well on one side. Then stir and continue to cook for 2 more minutes, until cooked through. Remove the steak from skillet and drain off any accumulated grease.
- Add the other tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet, along with the broccoli. Add 1/2 cup of water to the skillet and cover. Steam broccoli for 2 minutes. (Broccoli should be bright green and fork tender, but not mushy.)
- Transfer the steak back to the skillet, along with cooked noodles.
- Give the sauce a stir and pour into the skillet; using tongs, mix together the ingredients as the sauce cooks. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until everything is coated and warmed through.
- Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds.
